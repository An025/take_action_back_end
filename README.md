# Project Grande Spring Backend
Creating the Spring Boot Backend for our major project.
## Description
Our carbon footprint application written in React calls remote APIs to gather data for the carbon footprint calculations and offseting them.
Now, we will implement a more complete application which uses our basic spring backend and the already existing React front end.

Hope, we will create something useful and learn a lot from this project!
